# NeuralNetwork
Feedforward neural network with L2 regularization.

This project was a chance to learn the principles of neural networks. To this end, Michael Nielson's book, [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), was an invaluable resource. With Nielson's book, I learned the formal proofs behind concepts like backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, as well as the intuition central to understanding how these algorithms work. He also provides an implementation of a basic neural network in python, which was a great reference for my own implementation. I highly reccommend his book to anyone interested in the basics of machine learning.
